    <p><strong>The</strong> Dodgers, known today as the Los Angeles Dodgers, are an American professional baseball team that was founded in 1883 as the Brooklyn Atlantics. Interestingly enough, the team
      was known as the Bridegrooms, Grooms, Superbas, Robins, and Trolley Dodgers
      before officially becoming the Dodgers in the 1930s. In the 1950s, the Brooklyn Dodgers
      became the Los Angeles Dodgers as the team made its historic move to the West Coast in 1958. Despite the change in location, the Dodgers
      dominated the National League, winning five National League pennants (1952, 1953, 1955,
       1956, 1959) and World Championships in 1955 and 1959. In eight of the 10 years, the Dodgers never finished lower than second place while winning 913 games,
       the most wins in a decade in Dodger history. More info on Dodgers can be found <a href="http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/la/history/timeline.jsp">here</a> or on Wikipedia.</p>
       <blockquote> <em><strong>The</strong> Dodgers as a franchise have won six World Series titles and 21 National
           League pennants. 11 NL MVP award winners have played for the Dodgers, winning a
           total of 13 MVP Awards, Eight Cy Young Award winners have pitched for the
           Dodgers, winning a total of twelve Cy Young Awards. The team has also produced 17 Rookie
           of the Year Award winners, including four consecutive from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996.

    <p><strong>The</strong> Dodgers can not be talked about with mention of Vin Scully. He is a retired American sports broadcaster, and quite possibly, one of the greatest baseball broadcasters of all time.  His
      broadcasting tenure with the Dodgers spanned 7 decades, from 1950 to 2016.  In his final season
      behind the microphone, Scully announced most Dodger home games (and selected road games) on
      SportsNet LA television and KLAC radio. He is known for his dulcet voice, lyrically descriptive style,
      and signature introduction to Dodger games: "It's time for Dodger baseball! Hi, everybody, and a very pleasant good (afternoon/evening) to you, wherever you may be." He
      discovered his love of baseball at age 8 when he saw the results of the second game of the 1936 World Series at a laundromat and felt a pang of sympathy for the badly defeated New York Giants. Since he lived
      near the Polo Grounds and because he was a member of the PAL and CYO, he was able to attend many games for free and became a "very big Giants fan". He decided, at the tender age of eight, that
      he wanted to become a sports announcer, fascinated as he was by football radio broadcasts.</p>
